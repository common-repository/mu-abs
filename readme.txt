Requires at least: Mu 1.5.1
Tested up to: Mu 2.6.1
Stable tag: 0.1.4

When a logged in user visits a blog for which they have no capabilities (i.e. not subscriber), they are automatically added as a subscriber.


== Description ==

*** PLUGIN DEVELOPMENT ABANDONED - It is no longer useful and/or compatible with recent versions of WPMU or WP >= 3.0 ***

Mu-ABS (which stands for Mu Automatic Blog Subscription) is a mu-plugin for WordPress Mu.
When you build a blog network with such a platform, you probably wish that a user subscribed to one of your blogs is actually subscribed to each blog of the network. This does not natively happen with WordPress Mu.
This mu-plugin changes this behavior. When logged-in users visits a blog for which they have no capabilities (i.e. not subscriber), they are automatically and transparently added as a subscriber.

== Installation ==

1. Download the file
1. Unzip the archive
1. Upload the file `mu-abs.php` to the `mu-plugins` directory of your WordPress Mu installation
1. You are all set
